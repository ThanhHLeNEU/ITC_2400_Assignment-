        <p>Chez Fur welcomes you to come by for coffee and snacks. Stay to be entertained by our furry hosts as they play on 
            our outdoor Katio or indoor Kitty Kondo. While some of our hosts may be a bit shy, others happy to greet you
            with a request for a head scracht or gentel pet. Just let them lead the way! Sit back and enjoy the company of the
            cats. You might find that one of our cuddly kitties would like to adopt you.
        </p>
        <p>Reservation are recommended.</p>
